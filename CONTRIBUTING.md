# Open TBC Program
Welcome to the Open TBC Program, an initiative by Tech By Choice designed to offer cohort members hands-on experience with real-world projects. This program aims to bridge the gap between learning and employment by providing tangible project experience that members can showcase on their resumes, demonstrating their skills to prospective employers.

# Program Overview
The Open TBC Program is unique because it incorporates training and mentorship alongside practical work experience. Cohort members will participate in real team product cycles, working within diverse teams that extend beyond just developers. Our psychology-backed mentorship pairing program ensures each member is matched with a mentor who provides guidance through code reviews and feedback on design/project management, supporting contributors' growth and fostering leadership skills among mentors.

# Who Can Benefit?
This program is tailored for community members who are in the grey area of their tech journey. Whether you've just completed a boot camp, are transitioning from self-taught to employed, or looking to build leadership skills outside of work, the Open TBC Program is here to help you reach your next career milestone.

# Roles We're Looking For
We believe open source projects require a diverse set of skills, mirroring the real tech product development cycle. As such, we're looking to fill our cohort and mentor positions with individuals skilled in various areas, including:

- Product Managers
- UX Researchers/Designers

- Accessibility Developers
- Frontend Developers
- Backend Developers
